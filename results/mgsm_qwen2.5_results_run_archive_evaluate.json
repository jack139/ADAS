The feedback mechanism will evaluate the correctness of the answers and provide feedback to the decision-making process to refine the final answer. Implementation: 1.

Implement a robust feedback mechanism to evaluate the correctness of the answers. 4. Refine the decision-making process based on the feedback.",
